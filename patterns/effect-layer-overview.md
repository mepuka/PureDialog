Here is an overview of `Layer` based on the provided documentation.

### What is a Layer?

A [**`Layer<ROut, E, RIn>`**](https://www.google.com/search?q=%5Bhttps://effect-ts.github.io/effect/effect/Layer.ts.html%23layer-interface%5D\(https://effect-ts.github.io/effect/effect/Layer.ts.html%23layer-interface\)) is a fundamental building block in Effect for managing application dependencies. It can be thought of as a **recipe** that describes how to build one or more services (`ROut`).

This recipe can:

  * Have its own dependencies on other services (`RIn`).
  * Involve effectful logic that might fail (`E`).
  * Manage resources that need to be safely acquired and released.

Because of their excellent composition properties, layers are the idiomatic way to structure applications and manage dependencies in Effect.

### Key Characteristics

  * **Resource Safety**: Layers are built on top of `Scope`, ensuring that any resources they acquire (like database connections or file handles) are safely released when the application shuts down, even in the case of errors.
  * **Shared by Default**: Layers are automatically memoized. If the same layer is used multiple times in a dependency graph, its services will only be constructed once, and that single instance will be shared. You can opt out of this with [`Layer.fresh`](https://www.google.com/search?q=%5Bhttps://effect-ts.github.io/effect/effect/Layer.ts.html%23fresh%5D\(https://effect-ts.github.io/effect/effect/Layer.ts.html%23fresh\)).
  * **Composability**: Layers are designed to be composed together to build up the entire dependency graph for your application.

### Common Operations

#### Constructors

These are the primary ways to create a new layer:

  * **[`Layer.succeed`](https://www.google.com/search?q=%5Bhttps://effect-ts.github.io/effect/effect/Layer.ts.html%23succeed%5D\(https://effect-ts.github.io/effect/effect/Layer.ts.html%23succeed\))**: Creates a layer from a service that has already been constructed.
  * **[`Layer.effect`](https://www.google.com/search?q=%5Bhttps://effect-ts.github.io/effect/effect/Layer.ts.html%23effect%5D\(https://effect-ts.github.io/effect/effect/Layer.ts.html%23effect\))**: Creates a layer from an `Effect` that constructs the service. This is for services with an effectful initialization process.
  * **[`Layer.scoped`](https://www.google.com/search?q=%5Bhttps://effect-ts.github.io/effect/effect/Layer.ts.html%23scoped%5D\(https://effect-ts.github.io/effect/effect/Layer.ts.html%23scoped\))**: Creates a layer from a scoped effect, which is ideal for services that are backed by a resource that must be safely acquired and released.

#### Composition & Execution

  * **[`Layer.provide`](https://www.google.com/search?q=%5Bhttps://effect-ts.github.io/effect/effect/Layer.ts.html%23provide%5D\(https://effect-ts.github.io/effect/effect/Layer.ts.html%23provide\))**: The core composition function. It "wires" layers together by feeding the output of one layer into the input of another, satisfying its dependencies.
  * **[`Layer.merge`](https://www.google.com/search?q=%5Bhttps://effect-ts.github.io/effect/effect/Layer.ts.html%23merge%5D\(https://effect-ts.github.io/effect/effect/Layer.ts.html%23merge\))**: Combines two layers into a single layer that provides the services of both.
  * **[`Layer.launch`](https://www.google.com/search?q=%5Bhttps://effect-ts.github.io/effect/effect/Layer.ts.html%23launch%5D\(https://effect-ts.github.io/effect/effect/Layer.ts.html%23launch\))**: Builds the layer and runs it until interrupted. This is useful when your entire application is a long-running process defined as a layer, like an HTTP server.
  * **[`Layer.build`](https://www.google.com/search?q=%5Bhttps://effect-ts.github.io/effect/effect/Layer.ts.html%23build%5D\(https://effect-ts.github.io/effect/effect/Layer.ts.html%23build\))**: A lower-level function that constructs the layer and provides the resulting services within a `Scope`.
