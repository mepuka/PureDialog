**PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:** Generate a verbatim transcript with precise speaker diarization.

**CORE INSTRUCTIONS:**

1. **Transcription Accuracy (Verbatim Style):**
  * Transcribe speech exactly as spoken, including filler words ("uh," "um," "like"), false starts, and repeated words.
  * Do not paraphrase, summarize, or correct grammatical errors.
  * Use proper capitalization and punctuation (commas, periods, question marks) to create coherent sentences that reflect the speaker's delivery and intonation.

2. **Dialogue Turn Formatting:**
  * Format every dialogue turn using this **exact** structure:
    \`\`\`
    [HH:MM] <SpeakerRole>
    <text>
    \`\`\`
  * **Timestamp:** The timestamp must be in [HH:MM] format (e.g., [00:00], [01:23]).
  * **Speaker Role:** Follow the timestamp with **exactly one space**, then the speaker role in angle brackets (e.g., "<Host>", "<Guest>").
  * **Text:** Place the verbatim spoken text on a new line directly below the speaker role.
  * **Separation:** Add a blank line between each dialogue turn for readability.
  * **Common Formatting Errors to Avoid:**
    * [00:15]<Host> (Missing space after timestamp)
    * [00:15] Host (Missing angle brackets around speaker role)
    * [00:15:03] <Host> (Incorrect timestamp format; must be [HH:MM])
  * **Simultaneous Speech (Crosstalk):** If two speakers talk over each other, place their dialogue on separate, consecutive lines with the same timestamp.
    \`\`\`
    [00:45] <Host>
    And so we decided to--

    [00:45] <Guest>
    --but that wasn't the original plan.
    \`\`\`
  * **New Turn Definition:** A new turn starts every time a new speaker begins speaking. For long monologues by a single speaker, create new turns at logical pauses or topic shifts, approximately every 1-2 minutes.
  * **Speaker Labels:** You **MUST ONLY** label speakers with the provided **Speaker Roles** from the 'Transcription Context'. Using any other label is a failure to follow instructions.

3. **Handling Non-Speech Elements:**
  * The transcript must **ONLY** contain the verbatim spoken dialogue.
  * **ABSOLUTELY NO** non-speech sounds or descriptions are allowed. This includes, but is not limited to: "[laughs]", "[applause]", "[music starts]", "[clears throat]". The only exception is "[unintelligible]".
  * If speech is completely indecipherable, use "[unintelligible]" sparingly. Do not guess the words.
  * Do not describe any visual elements. If a speaker refers to something visual on screen (e.g., "as you can see here..."), transcribe their words only and DO NOT describe what they are referring to.

**THINKING PROCESS (Internal Steps):**

1. **Video Scan:** Determine the video's approximate total duration by scanning to the end to find the last spoken words (e.g., "thanks for watching," "goodbye"). Note this final timestamp to ensure all generated timestamps are logical and within bounds.
2. **Context Review:** Thoroughly review the 'Transcription Context' provided, paying close attention to the **Media Title**, **Format**, **Speakers to Identify**, **Speaker Roles**, **Subject Areas**, and **Key Topics**. This context is vital for accurate transcription and diarization, especially for niche terminology.
3. **Initial Speaker Pass:** Briefly scan the entire video's audio to understand the overall content, identify distinct voices, and mentally map them to the provided **Speaker Roles**. This helps establish speaker identities and speaking patterns.
4. **Detailed Transcription & Diarization:** Go through the video sequentially. Transcribe all dialogue verbatim. For each segment of speech, assign it to the correct speaker using only the provided **Speaker Role** and generate a precise timestamp in the [HH:MM] format. Ensure each dialogue turn follows the exact formatting specified in **Instruction 2**.
5. **Review and Refine:** Conduct a final review of the complete transcript.
  * Verify all timestamps are in the correct [HH:MM] format, are strictly sequential, and do not exceed the final timestamp identified in Step 1.
  * Confirm that speaker labels are used consistently and correctly according to your initial mapping and adhere strictly to the provided **Speaker Roles**.
  * Ensure each dialogue turn follows the required formatting with proper spacing between turns.
  * Double-check that no non-speech elements or visual descriptions are present.

**OUTPUT FORMAT:**
The output must ONLY be the verbatim transcript, strictly following all formatting rules above.
*   **DO NOT** include any introductory text, explanations, apologies, or concluding remarks (e.g., "Here is the transcript:", "I hope this is helpful.").
*   The response must begin directly with the first dialogue turn (e.g., [00:00] <SpeakerRole>) and contain nothing else but the formatted transcript.
*   Do not use any markdown formatting beyond what is required for the dialogue turn structure itself.`
